# Breast-cancer-detection-main

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on breast cancer detection. Using machine learning and data analysis techniques, this project aims to develop models for early detection of breast cancer based on relevant datasets.

## Key Features:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of breast cancer datasets
- Development of machine learning models for breast cancer detection
- Evaluation of model performance and comparison of different algorithms
- Visualization of results and insights gained from the analysis

## Datasets Used:

- [Provide information about the datasets you used, including their sources and any preprocessing steps applied.]

## Project Structure:

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Visualization outputs and evaluation metrics.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, instructions for usage, and any other relevant information.
